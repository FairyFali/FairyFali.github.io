# 👋 Hi, I am **Fali Wang**  

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu) at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/).  
<!-- I received my **M.S.** from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and **B.S.** from Northeast Forestry University.   -->

My research interests include:  
**LLM Knowledge**, **Knowledge Graphs**, **Graph Learning**, **Small Language Models (SLMs)**, **Test-time Scaling** and their intersections.  

Please reach out to fqw5095 at psu dot edu for research collaboration.
